# This is a file used to test the scala Option reader
# lines begining with the comment character (default "#") will be ignored
# all other lines are read for kv pairs in the following form
key=value
# bellow is another example to see if the reader can handle multiple configs
key2 = value2

# around this comment is some whitespace

# testing more meaningful values
val3=true
val4=2
